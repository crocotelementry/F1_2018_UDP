To run udp_client written in C takes two steps

1. First, build by running:


```
make
```


2. Second, to run the program, run the program and include the port to which it will listen on such as this example which uses port 5003:


```
./udp_client 5003
```





Note for Kristian: Plz clean up the structs.h code so it looks pretty!
