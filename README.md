# F1_2018_UDP
Working with the udp stream from the current F1 2018 game

This is a project that Kristian and I are using to experiment with the telemetry data sent from F1 2018 for PS4


Python Library requirements: 

* time
* threading
* random
* Queue
* socket
* ctypes
* sys
* binascii
* structs
* Tkinter
* socket
* ctypes
* sys
* binascii
* structs

I'll clean this up when I'm not so lazy. As some of these are included in the standard library.
